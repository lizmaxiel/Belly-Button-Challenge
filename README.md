# Belly-Button-Challenge
In this assignment, we were asked to develop an engaging interactive dashboard for exploring the **Belly Button Biodiversity dataset**. This dataset compiles information on the diverse microorganisms inhabiting human navels. Notably, the dataset uncovers that a select few microbial species, termed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the study, are prevalent in over 70% of individuals, while the remainder are relatively rare.

## Assignment Overview

The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset provides us with invaluable insights into the microbial composition residing within human navels. Our task is to construct a dynamic web-based dashboard, allowing users to delve into and visually interpret this dataset. Key features of this dashboard include:

- Selection of a test subject by their ID.
- Display of demographic information for the selected subject.
- Visualization of the top 10 OTUs found in the selected subject.
- Creation of a bubble chart displaying each sample.
- And more interactive elements for data exploration.

This assignment serves as an informative and engaging tool for investigating the world of belly button microbial diversity.
